For each of the above features you should do the following:

    Write a short program or programs to investigate its use. You may combine more than one feature into a single program.

    Explain how the feature works in Python and compare it to one or more languages with which you are familiar.

    Critique the implementation or use of the feature or construct.

interpretation
Python runs the code line by line rather than compiling the entire file. Very noticible when there are errors because it will stop at the exact line.

Boolean expressions

short circuit evaluation

numeric types
Python has quite a few built in data types with standouts being Sets, Touples, Dictionaries, and Complex Numbers. Notably missing are type keywords like short, unsigned, double

strings
Tested string manipulation. Noticed that when printing string literals, either quotes or apostophies can be used. If one is used, the other doesn't need to be escaped to print. There are several built in functions for Python strings like lower(), swapcase(). Operators are robus--including repetition "*", slicing "[]", and placeholders "%". Very powerful tools for formatting and placeholders. Allows for changing things like precision, numerical system (decimal/hex) within the print line. 

arrays
Cannot find built in array support, instead lists are used.

lists
Lists can contain any type of values and are dynamically sized.

tuples

slices

index range checking

dictionaries
Hash map data type. Keys must be immutable.

if statement

switch statement

for loop

while loop

indentation to denote code blocks

type binding

type checking

functions
